    <p>Make the updations to my project as the main objective of a project is to centralise all the college related information in one platform to provide quick access to the notes attendance and announcements to enhance the communication between second and students to enhance the academic productivity and time management 

Then solution approach campus user rule based login system the student teachers and administrator and parents can login access different modules the system store and display time table notes track attendance manage announcements it is built using open source technology to ensure cost effective in scalable implementation 
Scope of project is that the project is designed presently for only IIST isko thoda sa refine kar dena Apne hisab se aur thodi Si chijen add kar dena ki future mein update karke usko globally kar sakte hain. 

Existing system and limitations separate applications for like WhatsApp onnouncement Excel for attendance ERP systems were there but the lack of integrity automation and user friendly interfaces campus by combining all the academic features in one system. 

proposed methodology the system follows the approach where each module attendance time table notes are announcement is developed and tested separately requirement gathering system design implementation front and back and testing in validation moving forward to requirement and analysis problem defineing feasibility functional requirement is correct but make the changes used authentication time table management attendance tracking make separate point as notes management and separate point for announcement and notification system non functional requirement is correct technical requirement is all good in software requirement I am including rag also to mention that network requirement is correct software design include you ml diagram such as dfd diagram sequence diagram activity diagram class diagram include used case diagram 2 now moving to technology python with Jango only and adding rag database my SQL for storing API use kar rahe hain implemented communication between front and back and get her his use for the version control and project a moving to chapter 5 conclusion limitation and future work conclusion is successful integrated campus method academy functions into some it and answer the communication safe time improve function she will take limitations currently limited to at academic modules only require for future work integrated AIB is academic platform prediction site board support for queries reminders isko thoda AI base bnao as I am adding the chatbot to which can answer the questions of the students and give the sensible answer don't generate only generate answers if they want to scan anything about the notes to they can give the data from the data which we have uploaded</p>
